# SHADE

A privacy wallet for Solana.

## What Is This?

Most crypto wallets show everything - your balance, your transactions, who you send money to. SHADE is different.

**With SHADE, you can:**
- Create a wallet, use it once, then destroy it (like a burner phone)
- Get paid to an address that can't be linked back to you
- Prove you have enough money without showing exactly how much you have
- Keep everything encrypted on your device - nothing goes to any server

**Why it matters:**
- Privacy is a basic right
- Your financial transactions are your business, not everyone else's
- Same security banks use, but for crypto

## How It Works

1. **Burner Wallets** - Like temporary phone numbers. Use once, throw away.
2. **Stealth Addresses** - One-time addresses that don't reveal who you are.
3. **ZK Proofs** - Math that proves things without revealing information.

## Simple Comparison

| Your keys, your coins | ✅ | ✅ |

## Security

All encryption happens in your browser using military-grade encryption. Nothing is sent to any server. Your keys, your coins.
