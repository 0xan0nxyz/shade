# SHADE Wallet — Pitch Deck

## 🎯 One-Liner
**Privacy wallet for Solana: Burner wallets + Stealth addresses + Military-grade encryption**

---

## 💀 The Problem

**Your crypto wallet is a glass house.**

- Every transaction is public forever
- Anyone can see your balance
- Addresses can be linked to your identity
- No financial privacy on public blockchains

**$2.3B lost to hacks in 2024** — many started with on-chain analysis identifying high-value targets.

## 💡 The Solution

**SHADE: Financial privacy for Solana**

| Feature | What It Does |
|---------|--------------|
| **Burner Wallets** | Create, use, destroy. No trace. |
| **Stealth Addresses** | One-time addresses for each payment |
| **Passkey Login** | No seed phrase. Biometric access. |
| **Gasless Tx** | Pay fees from a hidden wallet |
| **Military Encryption** | AES-256, 310k iterations, self-destruct |

---

## 🔐 How It Works

```
Traditional Wallet:
Alice → Bob → Charlie  (All visible, all linked)

SHADE:
Alice → Burner_1 → Stealth_A  (Unlinkable, untraceable)
              ↓
         [Destroyed]
```

## 🏆 Why Now?

1. **Regulatory pressure** — Privacy becoming a necessity, not luxury
2. **Institutional entry** — Funds need operational security
3. **Solana growth** — 4000 TPS, <$0.01 fees, but no privacy
4. **Monero delistings** — Users need privacy without leaving exchanges
